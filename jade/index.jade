          | I came back to Nashville in early 2009 to take care of my father, who was ill. I had recently sold a financial services business in Chicago and was able to do this whereas my two older sisters had busy working lives and were not.
        p
          | After about three months in Nashville, I decided “why not stay here?” I had lived here in the 80’s, hada great group of friends that I had kept in touch with over the years, and Nashville had grown up into a truly vibrant, cultural city.
        p
          | I decided to focus on a long-held dream of owning a bar and grill. I had paid my dues in my teens and twenties in all aspects of the hospitality business, both in Nashville and Chicago, so it wasn’t like I was going in cold.
        p
          | As fate would have it, I wandered in to The Bellevue Pub in late 2009. I learned from several regulars there that this place had once been a great neighborhood gathering place going back 25 years, but over the last 6 years had gone severely downhill due primarily to absentee ownership. They longed to have it back!
        p
          | After four years of unsuccessfully trying to negotiate with two failing owners, the bar finally closed in November of 2013, and I immediately stepped in. Ironically, I had also met the love of my life, Angie, at The Bellevue Pub in October 2009. She was bartending there to make ends meet as a realtor during that terrible time in the market. We have been together ever since, and have pursued this dream together.
        p
          | Our goal was to completely revitalize the once-great Bellevue Pub and bring it back to the community.We realized that it had developed a very negative stigma over recent years, so the decision was made to shut it down, completely remodel it, and re-open it under a new name. We both love the school “vibe” and wanted to bring this type of music together with great food and a clean, crisp, female-friendly atmosphere. After much deliberating, Angie hit on a name that rang true to both of us immediately. Throwbacks Bar & Grill was born!
        p
          | We hope you visit us soon and regularly to meet our friendly staff, enjoy great food & drink, live music on our full stage, karaoke, our old-school shuffleboard table, real dart boards, our daily specials, and more!!
